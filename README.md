project 3 prevent training

This project is a formative assessment for Code Institute in which I'm building a one page website on the theme of PREVENT.
PREVENT is the UK governments' strategy for preventing radicalisation and for enabling people to disengage from radicalism.

This project will avoid provocative imagery and will be strong on textual information. This presents a UX challenge: 
to balance readability and visual clarity against the high word count. Text content on the website will be summarised from
official sources. Links will be provided to the relevant web pages.

The expected USER is somebody who works in a sector covered by the Prevent duty.
