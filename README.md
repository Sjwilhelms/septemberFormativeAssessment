project 3 prevent training

This project is a formative assessment for Code Institute in which I'm building a one page website on the theme of PREVENT.
PREVENT is the UK governments' strategy for preventing radicalisation and for enabling people to disengage from radicalism.

This project will avoid provocative imagery and will be strong on textual information. This presents a UX challenge: 
to balance readability and visual clarity against the high word count. 

USER STORIES

As a site user I can access information on the governments strategy

As a site user I can access said information in discrete sections

As a site user I can follow links to other pertinent overnment resources

As a site user I can follow a link straight to PREVENT training
